C++/GLUT Mandlebrot Project
###########################

This is an experimental project combining Sphinx, sphinx-tut and Git
submodules to build a TDD lecture on building a graphics application that
generates Mandlebrot images. The project is intended to be used as an example when teaching about C++ classes.

The documentation sources are a submodule of this project in the ``docs`` subdirectory, and the project code is another submodule in the ``code`` subdirectory.

THis entire project is continuously tested using TrasisCI.
