C++/GLUT Mandlebrot Project
###########################

..  image:: https://img.shields.io/travis/rblack42/cosc1337_Mandlebrot.svg

This is an experimental project combining Sphinx, sphinx-tut and Git submodules
to build a TDD lecture on building a graphics application that generates
Mandlebrot images. The project is intended to be used as an example when
teaching about C++ classes.

The documentation sources are a submodule of this project in the ``docs``
subdirectory, and the project code is another submodule in the ``code``
subdirectory.

This entire project is continuously tested using Travis-CI.
